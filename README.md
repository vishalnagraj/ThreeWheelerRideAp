2. **Install Dependencies**:
    In your project directory, run the following command to install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. **Set Up Firebase**:
    - Go to the Firebase console and create a new project.
    - Enable Firebase Authentication, Firestore Database, and Firebase Cloud Messaging for your project.
    - Download the `google-services.json` for Android and place it in the `android/app` directory of the project.

4. **Configure Google Maps API**:
    - Obtain a Google Maps API key from the Google Cloud Console.
    - Add the key to your Android project in the `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file:
      ```xml
      <meta-data
          android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
          android:value="YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"/>

    flutter run
    ```

## Folder Structure
The project is organized as follows:


## How the App Works
### Passenger Side:
- **Booking a Ride**: Passengers can input their pickup and drop-off locations. The app will display available three-wheelers nearby.
- **Ride Tracking**: Passengers can track the ride's status in real-time on the map.
- **Payment Integration**: After completing the ride, passengers can pay via integrated payment gateways.

### Driver Side:
- **Ride Request**: Drivers can view incoming ride requests, accept them, and navigate to the pickup location.
- **Trip Management**: Drivers can manage ongoing and completed trips and view their earnings.

### Admin Panel:
- **User Management**: Admin can view all users (both passengers and drivers), manage their accounts, and monitor ride histories.
- **Reporting**: Admin can access detailed reports for ride analytics, driver performance, and payment history.

## Testing
To test the app:
- Use Firebase authentication to create test user accounts (both passenger and driver).
- Test real-time ride booking by creating multiple test users (for both passengers and drivers) and simulate ride requests.
